## Hi, I’m Gregg Eschelmuller 👋

I'm a PhD Candidate (Neuromechanics) at the University of British Columbia, bridging the gap between human neuroscience and "real tech."

My research focuses on proprioception, sensory feedback, and motor learning. I don't just analyze this data—I build the real-time hardware platforms (**Python, NI-DAQ**) to capture it and the Bayesian models (**PyMC, Scikit-learn**) to understand it.

I'm pivoting from academia to a full-time role in **Neurotech, Robotics, or ML Research**, where I can use my domain expertise in human-machine interaction to help build next-generation systems.

### 🌱 My Current 4-Pillar Focus

This is my 6-month plan to finish my PhD and pivot to tech.

1.  **Build Pillar Projects:** Creating a professional portfolio of my 3 core projects (see my pinned repositories below!):
    * **Pillar 1:** A real-time hardware platform for human-in-the-loop motor control.
    * **Pillar 2:** A Bayesian model translating my PhD research on proprioceptive illusions.
    * **Pillar 3:** A Bayesian state-space model for cue combination.
2.  **Write "Translator" Blog:** Writing on [my personal site](https://greggeschelmuller.github.io/personal-site/) to connect the dots between motor control, ML, and real-world tech.
3.  **Finish Neurotech Credential:** Completing my Neurotech Microcredential (Neuro Electronic Recording, Neuroimaging).
4.  **Master the Foundation:** Working through *Mathematics for Machine Learning* to solidify my theoretical base.
