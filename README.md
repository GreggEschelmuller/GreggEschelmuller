# Hi, I’m Gregg Eschelmuller

I am a PhD Candidate and Quantitative Researcher at the University of British Columbia specializing in signal processing and probabilistic modeling.

My work centers on **extracting signal from noisy, stochastic environments.** I focus on building the mathematical and engineering infrastructure required to infer the true state of complex systems from high-dimensional datasets.

I am currently transitioning my background in Bayesian state estimation and automated data pipelines into industry roles in **Data Science**, **Quantitative Analysis**, and **Research Engineering**.

### Technical Arsenal

* **Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels), PyTorch, SQL, MATLAB.
* **Modeling:** Bayesian Inference, Latent State Estimation, Causal Inference, System Identification.
* **Engineering:** Automated ETL Pipelines, Stateless Architecture, Vectorized Processing, `uv`, `pytest`.
* **Data Visualization:** Plotly Dash, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### Key Focus Areas

#### Probabilistic State Estimation
I develop generative models to solve problems of uncertainty in complex systems. While my primary data source is biological, the underlying mathematics involves using **Bayesian frameworks** to reconcile conflicting signals and identify latent parameters in high-noise environments. 

#### Automated Signal Processing at Scale
I engineer modular, configuration-driven pipelines designed to process and validate datasets exceeding **millions of observations**. My focus is on operational reliability: ensuring that analysis is 100% reproducible through strict dependency management and automated validation schemas.

#### System Identification
I map the response characteristics of non-linear feedback loops using broadband noise injection and spectral analysis. I utilize linear systems tools, including coherence, gain, and phase, to characterize dynamic relationships, assess information content across time scales, and validate the structural integrity of complex models against empirical data.
